Meeting protocal, 29.08.2019

- Engine spec.
  -> Power, max @ 7-8000 rpm
  -> Torque, max @ 6.5-7000 rpm
- Gear set
  -> Using 15:60 teeths (1:4)
- Sensors
  -> Hot wire -> tested, ok
  -> Thermo couple -> tested, ok
  -> Proximity (measuring RPM) -> on progress!!!
  -> Fuel flow meter -> on progress!!!, consulting with TOS
- Torque sensors
  -> Tested, ok
  -> T(engine, max) 6 N.m @ 10000
  -> T(sensor, max) 50 N.m, RPM (max) 4000
  -> Price for the new one c.a. 100k THB, preferring the available one!!!
  -> Locating after gear set, with 1:4 ratio, probably measuring max 4*T(engine) = 24 N.m -> in range of equipment, hawever, careful during starting!
  -> Finding conversion factor (positioning torque sensor in front and behind gear set)

- Next week
  -> Design gear set
  -> Test all sensors
  -> Positioning torque sensor
